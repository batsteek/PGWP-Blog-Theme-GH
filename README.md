# PGWP-Blog-Theme-GH
PG-Blog Free WordPress Theme (sources files for Pinegrow PRO+WP)

PG-Blog is a very light and responsive Free WordPress parent theme dedicated to blog writers who like
simplicity and who want to focus on the content.

Created with Pinegrow PRO+WP, It is designed with simple HTML and CSS.
There are no fancy animations, no javascripts and no marketing gimmicks.

Note: This the the very first version of the PG-Blog theme and while we are working hard to provide a clean result,
some issues are still possible 

IMPORTANT NOTICE: From Pinegrow, don't forget to EDIT the WordPress site settings of index.html with your custom settings (particularly the Theme Folder)
